# Happy-Customers

In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset consisting of customer survey data to identify the most significant attributes of the data.  Secondly, I apply several classification models and identify the best-performing models in regard to accuracy.  The delivery service company can identify which features of their service or product are most significant for customer satisfaction in order to focus on projects that matter.  The company can also gauge how well it is doing in various aspects of their service or product.
